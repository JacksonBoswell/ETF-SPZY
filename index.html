    Our strategy: We buy out-of-the-money puts and sell out-of-the-money calls
    at the end of each Friday using MOC orders. The contracts will last one week
    their expiration date being the next Friday. The number of puts that we buy,
    and the number of calls that we sell, will correspond to the number of
    shares we have of the underlying (SPX).

    We choose the strike so that the number of put contracts we want to buy times the put 
    price for that strike is equal to X. In other words, we want to invest $X in
    puts. Likewise, we want to sell $X worth of calls. However, in a real market, this is
    unlikely, so a small frictional cost is associated with this strategy.

    A major issue is that not all strikes are available. Moreover, some of
    the ones that are available may not be liquid enough. Hence, we only consider
    options that have passed a liquidity threshold: 25% most liquid out-of-the-money strike
    prices and percentage difference between bid and ask.<br>
